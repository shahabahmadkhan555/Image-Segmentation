# Image-Segmentation
1. Built a custom image segmentation model using Tensorflow 2 and Keras.
2. Used Mask RCNN with pre-trained weights on MS COCO dataset to generate predictions. 
3. Dataset used has more than 330,000 image files belonging to different categories of objects.
4. Tech stack used was Tensorflow, Keras, OpenCV, Numpy, Pandas, Python.
